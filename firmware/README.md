# Xenium Flash Firmware

### This is the Verilog source code for the Xenium Flash Memory programming.

- Its fairly straight forward, the CPLD acts as a bridge between the Raspberry PI (or any other device) and the OpenXenium Flash memory and translates writing and reading instructions from a single 4-bit bus to a 21-bit Address + 8-bit bus.
